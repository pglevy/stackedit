# Joining SID-W as a Health and Nutrition Workgroup Co-Chair; What it Means to Me and Plans for the Future!

Last week, I was excited to learn I was chosen to serve as co-chair for the  [Health and Nutrition workgroup](https://sidw.org/workgroups/health-nutrition)  with the Society for International Development – Washington Chapter (SID-W).

SID-W is one of the largest networks among international development professionals and is very active in bringing together thought leaders based in the Washington, DC metropolitan area and around the globe.

Members range from institutional leaders to young professionals who sit within international non-government organizations (NGOs), embassies, and private sector entities.

The Health and Nutrition workgroup is one of the many workgroups hosted within the network and intersects with other thematic groups focused on information, communication, and technology (ICT), education, and many others.

Over the next two years, my co-chair,  [Dr. Lara S. Ho](https://sidw.org/dr-lara-s-ho-mhs-phd-rn), and I will be planning 2-3 events per year focusing on the advancement of health and nutrition. We will be reaching within our respective institutions and networks to identify relevant and timely topics to showcase for these events.

The SID-W network brings small businesses and large institutions together, and I’m thrilled to represent Bixal as part of the U.S. small business community, advancing our growing footprint in international development focused on health and nutrition.

As co-chair of the Health and Nutrition workgroup, I look forward to drawing on Bixal’s innovations in the health sector to share human-centered design (HCD) practices that address and solve complex health challenges.

For example, Bixal is using HCD, agile methodologies, and innovative technologies on USAID-funded projects. We have developed a public-facing knowledge management platform for the  [Global Health Supply Chain – Procurement and Supply Management](https://www.ghsupplychain.org/)  (GHSC-PSM) project , and are a lead knowledge management and learning partner to USAID’s Bureau for Resilience and Food Security via our  [Feed the Future Knowledge, Data, Learning and Training (KDLT)](https://legacy.bixal.com/blog-post/bixal-awarded-usaid-feed-future-kdlt-contract)  activity.

As I continue to learn more about SID-W, I am inspired to be part of this community of thought leaders and practitioners, especially at a time when remaining connected to like-minded individuals is so important.

I look forward to what the year brings and in working with colleagues across the SID-W network, and within Bixal, contributing to the broader discussions related to health and nutrition!
